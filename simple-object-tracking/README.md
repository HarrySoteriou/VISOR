# In this repository I uploaded my modifications to the simple object tracking file from: #

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/category/object-tracking/

### Some comments (feel free to comment on these):

1. In the [object_tracking.py](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/object_tracker.py) file I added a print view of info_df. This 'info_df' should have been created in the centroidtracking.py script. 

The intention of this dataframe is that we get a pd dataframe output as follows:

```
info_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ["object_id", "frame_number", "center_coordinate"])
```

I've tried to update the dataframe after a new object_ID was assigned (based on the bounding box generated by the detection model for
a specific frame). Combined with the centroid that was calculated using the bounding box coordinates.

The detection model is this file:

* [res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel)
* **Harry** this is basically where your model should be used in the file

### You can run the object tracker form your command line like this:

```
cd C:\Users\20184364\Downloads\simple-object-tracking> (wherever you saved the folder!)
``` 
And then: 

```
python object_tracker.py --prototxt deploy.prototxt --model res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
```

### This is the intention of editing the centroid tracker file:
1. `done`: write the centroid location for a detected object to a dataframe 
1. `done`: write that dataframe to a csv file so we can request it in the object tracker
1. `done`: add the frame number to the corresponding centroid of that frame in the csv file, so we know when/what happened.
1. use the centroid information in the csv file as a means to detect anomalies among the detected objects
