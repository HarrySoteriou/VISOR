### Some comments (feel free to comment on these):

1. In the [object_tracking.py](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/object_tracker.py) file I added a print view of info_df. This 'info_df' should have been created in the centroidtracking.py script. 

The intention of this dataframe is that we get some information about the location of an object (per frame) as follows:

```
info_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ["object_id", "frame_number", "coordinate x", "coordinate y"])
```

I've tried to update the dataframe after a new object_ID was assigned based on the bounding box generated by the detection model. Currently, the detection model is a `caffe` model but should be substituted with `our own model` in the near future. The x and y coordinate for an object were calculated using the output of [centroidtracker.py](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/centroidtracker.py) and were stored per frame.

The detection model:

* [res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel)

### You can run the object tracker form your command line like this:

```
cd C:\Users\20184364\Downloads\simple-object-tracking> (... wherever YOU saved the folder!)
``` 
And then: 

```
python object_tracker.py --prototxt deploy.prototxt --model res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
```
