# In this repository I uploaded my modifications to the simple object tracking file from: #

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/category/object-tracking/

Some comments (feel free to comment on these):

1. In the [object_tracking.py](https://github.com/HarrySoteriou/VISOR/blob/master/simple-object-tracking/object_tracker.py) file I added a print view of info_df. This 'info_df' should have been created in the centroidtracking.py script. 

The intention of this dataframe is that we get a pd dataframe output as follows:

```
info_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ["object_id", "frame_number", "center_coordinate"])
```

I've tried to update the dataframe after a new object_ID was assigned (based on the bounding box generated by the detection model for
a specific frame). Combined with the centroid that was calculated using the bounding box coordinates.

=============

The detection model is this file:

* **res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel**

You can run the object tracker form your command line like this:

```
cd C:\Users\20184364\Downloads\simple-object-tracking> (wherever you saved the folder!)
``` 
And then: 

```
python object_tracker.py --prototxt deploy.prototxt --model res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
```
