#In this repository I uploaded my modifications to the simple object tracking file from:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/category/object-tracking/

Some comments (feel free to comment on these):

1. In the object_tracking.py file I added a print view of info_df. This 'info_df' should have been created in the centroidtracking.py script. 
The intention of this dataframe is that we get a pd dataframe output as follows:

     	 info_df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ["object_id", "frame_number", "center_coordinate"])
  
I've tried to update the dataframe after a new object_ID was assigned (based on the bounding box generated by the detection model for
a specific frame). Combined with the centroid that was calculated using the bounding box coordinates.

The detection model is this file:
	res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
