### The REAL to-do list:

| Task                                                                                |     DONE    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
| Use the center of the object to track throughout frames                             |      ✔️     |
| write the centroid location for a detected object to a dataframe                    |      ✔️     |
| `modified:` write that dataframe to a csv file so we can request it                 |      ✔️     |
| add the frame number to the corresponding centroid of that frame in the csv file    |      ✔️     |
| label more images for training so we get a better model                             |      ❌     |
| use information in the csv file to detect anomalies among the detected objects      |      ❌     |
| connect our trained model to the tracking script                                    |      ❌     |
